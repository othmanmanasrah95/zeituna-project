# ðŸŒ¿ Zeituna Project - A to Z Implementation Plan for a Team

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Zeituna is a blockchain-enabled marketplace managed by Tourath Inc., offering premium olive oil, an Adopt an Olive Tree program, and handcrafted products. This plan outlines the step-by-step implementation of the project by a team divided into three main roles:

- **Frontend Team (React + Vite)**
- **Backend Team (Node.js + Express)**
- **Smart Contract Team (Solidity + Blockchain)**

- Backend Team:

  - Initialize Node.js + Express server.
  - Set up MongoDB connection (Mongoose).
  - Set up environment variables (.env).

- Smart Contract Team:
